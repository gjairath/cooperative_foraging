# cooperative_foraging

A project I whipped up at some point in my adult life to see how agents grapple with challenges more aptly modeled by socially sequential dilemmas.

The only social dillemas I've struggled with were with multiple-women who are currently in the scorned status.

For the curious: <br>
Dimitri P. Bertsekas, A course in RL OR The MARL book (For higher level). <br>
Suttons intro to RL is good for the excercises but the text swaps so many times from passive to active voice, I can't even. <br>
Most of the DP stuff on there is basic coding anyway. It gets interesting in the last few chapters and then fades away very quickly.
